# Get Started

## Initial Setup

Pre: Ensure the Decide platform is in production and the Telos Works account has registered as a voter to the core treasury.

1. Initial contract setup begins by calling the init() action. This created the config table and readies the contract for usage.

2. Top up the Telos Works fund by transferring TLOS to the contract.

### Tip: To skip notification logic use the "skip" memo - this is useful for managing contrct resources without mixing tokens with the Wax Labs accounting.
